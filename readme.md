We have already made the texture maps available on our [database portal](https://opensvbrdf.github.io/). Here, we attach the calculation method of the GGX anisotropic BRDF used in our entire system, for everyone to use as a reference when rendering data.


First, a local coordinate system (onb) for rendering is established based on the normal and tangent. Then, $\omega_{i}$, $\omega_{o}$, onb, and other parameters are used as inputs to call the GGX_BRDF.eval() method, which will return the BRDF value. 

Our implementation references the formulas in the article [Physically-based shading at Disney](https://media.disneyanimation.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/48/asset/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v3.pdf).


The rest of the code is currently being organized and will be coming soon. If youâ€™re interested in our project, we warmly welcome you to star our repository. This will make it easier for you to find our updates in the future.
